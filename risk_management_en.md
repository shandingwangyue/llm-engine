# Risk Assessment and Response Strategy

## üö® Technical Risks

### 1. Memory Overflow Risk
**Risk Description**: Large models require substantial memory, easily leading to OOM errors
**Impact Level**: High
**Probability**: Medium

**Response Strategy**:
- Implement dynamic memory monitoring and early warning
- Set memory usage thresholds (e.g., 80% automatic alert)
- Develop graceful degradation mechanisms
- Support model quantization to reduce memory usage

```python
# Memory monitoring implementation
def check_memory_usage():
    import psutil
    memory = psutil.virtual_memory()
    if memory.percent > 80:
        # Trigger alert or degradation
        logger.warning("Memory usage exceeds 80%")
        return False
    return True
```

### 2. Performance Bottleneck Risk
**Risk Description**: Response time increases dramatically under high concurrency
**Impact Level**: High
**Probability**: Medium

**Response Strategy**:
- Implement request queue and rate limiting mechanisms
- Add caching layer to reduce repeated computations
- Support asynchronous processing to improve throughput
- Develop batch processing optimization

### 3. Model Compatibility Risk
**Risk Description**: Incomplete support for different model formats
**Impact Level**: Medium
**Probability**: High

**Response Strategy**:
- Adopt modular design, support plugin-style model loading
- Provide detailed model format requirement documentation
- Implement automatic model detection and conversion tools
- Establish model validation test suite

## üîí Security Risks

### 1. API Abuse Risk
**Risk Description**: Unauthorized access and malicious requests
**Impact Level**: High
**Probability**: Medium

**Response Strategy**:
- Implement API key authentication
- Add rate limiting and IP blacklist
- Record complete access logs
- Regular API usage audits

### 2. Data Leakage Risk
**Risk Description**: Sensitive prompt or generated content leakage
**Impact Level**: High
**Probability**: Low

**Response Strategy**:
- Implement end-to-end encryption (optional)
- Add data masking functionality
- Strict access control policies
- Regular security vulnerability scanning

## üíæ Operations Risks

### 1. Service Availability Risk
**Risk Description**: Single point of failure leading to service interruption
**Impact Level**: High
**Probability**: Low

**Response Strategy**:
- Implement health checks and automatic restart
- Deploy multiple instances with load balancing
- Set up monitoring alert system
- Prepare disaster recovery plan

### 2. Model Management Risk
**Risk Description**: Model file corruption or version conflicts
**Impact Level**: Medium
**Probability**: Low

**Response Strategy**:
- Implement model file validation mechanism
- Support model version management
- Regular model file backups
- Provide model recovery tools
